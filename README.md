# My discord bot

My personal own discord bot. I doubt you will want to run it yourself, I'll just upload its source code here because I feel like it.

---

### Dependencies:
* pysocks
* [charactersay}(https://github.com/crawltime/charactersay)
* requests
* tor as a daemon running on port 9050
* a unix-like os, unless you wanna change the file paths for the peudo-random cringe video thing.
* asyncio
* datetime
* discord.py (obviously)
